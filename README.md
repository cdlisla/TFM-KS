# TFM-Performance Management Analysis in logistic companies
We will put in this repository all the advances of our TFM: Performance Management Analysis in logistic companies.

# Description
Using the datasets that provides a "GPS trucking device" of a logistic company, analyzing routes, fuel consumption, accidents and other variables, we want to obtain a model in order to classify the workers, acording to their performance and comparing with the actual classification that the company has.

All our datasets are privates, so we will add commits with the code, except the drivers Id's, names, trucks registrations, etc.
